# Sound of the Bees

## Coding Circle
Duration: 5:00

positive
: This activity is designed to introduce the fundamental concepts of programming within a fun, active setting. Students are on their feet and engaging with this activity throughout. 

Students form a circle or a line and each one is given a piece of A4 paper with a line of Python code on it. 
 
Within the code, there will be a *spelling error*, a *variable* definition, an *if statement* and a *loop*. The tutor should discuss these various programming constructs as the students move around the circle. 

Some examples of writing on each card are below: 

``` 
print('Boom!')
jump()
prin('Test') #Note deliberate spelling error!
if <next person is wearing glasses>:
for n in range(1,3):
```

### Key Concepts:
* Spelling is critical in programming.
* Variables are used to store infomation to be used later in the code. 
* Conditional if statements ask a question of the computer, and run some code when the condition is met. 
* For and while loops can be used to repeat processes iteratively.
